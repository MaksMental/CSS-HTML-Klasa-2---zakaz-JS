        <h1>Gryffindor</h1>
        The name of the house comes from the name of its founder - Godryk Gryffindor. Gryffindor competed for many years with Salazar Slytherin, who wanted only pureblood wizards to attend Hogwarts. The quarrel forever divided the friends. Slytherin soon left school, and Hogwarts was divided into four houses: Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin and Gryffindor. The pupils of the house are characterized by courage, chivalry and determination, boldness, as well as the ability to stay cool in difficult situations.
        <br>
        Its members are usually considered courageous, although this sometimes leads to recklessness. They can also be passionate. It is worth noting that many students joined Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix. For other people, as well as members of other households, Gryffindors often engage in "pointless heroism." Severus Snape found many Gryffindors hypocritical and arrogant, unlawful.
        <br>
        Practically from the very beginning of the school's operation, you can notice a fierce rivalry between Slytherins and Gryffindors, which was initiated by a conflict between the founders: Slytherin and Gryffindor. The conflict stemmed from the views of Slytherin that only pure-blooded students should be admitted to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        <br>
        The Slytherins also envied Gryffindor to have Harry Potter in their ranks and to win in most situations. Examples include the addition of points to Gryffindor at the last minute by Dumbledore, who allowed the Gryffindors to win the House Cup in the 1991-1992 school year, and the selection of Harry as fourth player in the Triwizard Tournament.
        <br>
        During the Second War, the Gryffindors were mostly opponents of Voldemort, and during the Battle of Hogwarts, most of the students from this house were found to defend the school against the Dark Lord and his henchmen.
        Common room <br>
        This room is located in one of the towers of Hogwarts Castle, on the seventh floor, the entrance to which is guarded by an oil portrait of a Fat Lady who is wearing a pink silk gown. It allows entry only after saying the correct password (regularly changed).

        Upon entering the doorway, you will notice a large lounge with fireplace and two staircases leading to the girls 'and boys' bedrooms. A spell has been cast on the stairs leading to the girls' dormitories to prevent any boys from entering their bedrooms. There is no such spell on the stairs leading to the boys 'dormitories, because, according to the founders' belief, "girls are more trustworthy".

        The room is very comfortable, and members of the Gryffindor house meet there for celebrations or simply relaxing after a busy day of study. There are portraits of former Gryffindor students on the walls. The colors of the house dominate the room - red and gold.
