        Hermione Jean Weasley née Granger (born September 19, 1979) - a fictional character from the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. She is a student at Hogwarts, where - along with Ron Weasley - she is one of Harry Potter's best friends. Her favorite subject is spells. Her parents are Muggles, dentists by profession. He shares the dormitory with Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown. Hermione has long, thick, brown and rather disheveled hair, eyes that are the same color, and slightly protruding upper teeth. A Muggle-born witch; the only daughter of dentists - Mrs. and Mr. Granger; wife of Ron Weasley, mother of his two children, Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley; a close friend of Harry Potter. In 1991–1999, a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was assigned to Gryffindor. In 1995, she became a prefect and took part in the Battle of Hogwarts. After Lord Voldemort's death, Hermione - unlike Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley - returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to complete her seventh year of study. Shortly after the Owutems, she began working at the Ministry of Magic in the Magical Creatures Control Department, where she played a significant role in improving the lives of house elves and their families. She then transferred to the Wizarding Law Enforcement Department, where she was a progressive voice that ensured the eradication of oppressive laws that favor pureblood. For achievements, Hermione, Harry and Ron were placed on cards attached to chocolate frogs.
        Hermione meanwhile married Ron Weasley, with whom she had two children: Rose and Hugo. They both looked like their father, although Ron himself emphasized that Rose must have inherited her mother's intellect. Hermione found her parents in Australia and removed the memory of memory modification right away.

        On September 1, 2017, she and her husband took the children to platform 9¾. There, they met Harry and Ginny, who were also escorting their children. Hermione talked to her daughter for a moment, kissed her forehead fondly, and waved goodbye. She was so thrilled by the whole event and proudly watched her child depart for Hogwarts as she did. Together with her husband and son, they watched the children on the platform. Draco and Astoria also said goodbye to their son in their company.

        That same year, Ron passed his Muggle driving license exam, though Hermione didn't believe he would.
