        Harry James Potter (born July 31, 1980) - a half-blood wizard, the only child of James and Lily Potter. The most famous wizard of the 20th century.
        It owes its fame to a prophecy made in the early 1980s by Sibyl Trelawney about Lord Voldemort and a boy born at the end of the seventh month. During this period, two boys were born, however, it was Harry who was chosen to be equal to the Dark Lord.

        In October 1981, Lord Voldemort killed Harry's parents who were hiding with the Fidelius spell in Godric's Valley, wanting to protect their only one-year-old and only child at all costs. They were published by Peter Pettigrew, who did not even want to think about dying for his friend and his wife. This early attempt to remove an obstacle to ruling the wizarding world had failed and led to the end of the First Wizarding War, which was synonymous with the fall of the Dark Lord. From that moment on, the whole world knew Harry as "The Boy Who Lived", the only person who had survived the murderous spell so far.

        One consequence of Lily sacrificing her life in the name of love for a child was that Harry was forced to live with his only living relatives, the Dursley family. It was a Muggle family he would live with until he was seventeen, as long as his mother's magic was in charge of him.

        On his eleventh birthday, he learned the truth about his origin and who he really was from Dumbledore's commissioned half-giant and gamekeeper at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. On September 1, 1991, he was assigned to Gryffindor. During his school years, he made friends with two other Gryffindors - Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, and became the youngest seeker in his century.

        He deepened his fame in the wizarding world by protecting the Philosopher's Stone from revival Lord Voldemort and saving the life of Ron's younger sister Ginny during his sophomore year and killing the basilisk. In addition, he emphasized his extraordinary magical abilities, being able to conjure a corporeal Patronus at the age of thirteen. During his fourth year, he won the Triwizard Tournament, although the victory came with the death of his schoolmate Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort, and was largely aided by Crouch Jr. who pretended to be Mad-Eyed Barty. He had to fight backlash from the Ministry of Magic, which did not believe in the Dark Lord's return, calling him a liar. The following year, he fought in the Department of Mysteries and saw the death of the recently met godfather, Sirius Black.

        Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War, and was also responsible for finding and destroying Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he witnessed the deaths of many people close to him. He stood on equals in the face of death, knowing that this was the only way to get closer to defeating the Dark Lord. In Limba, he met Albus Dumbledore, who, as always, supported him with wise advice and helped him make a choice. He returned to the "world of the living" and defeated Tom Marvolo Riddle once and for all.

        Harry Potter was also the only known Death Lord to hold three Deathly Hallows at any one time.

        After the war, Harry became an Auror and helped reform the Ministry of Magic alongside the new Minister, Kingsley.

        At one point in his life, he married Ginny Weasley, with whom he had three children: two sons and a daughter. He was chosen as godfather to the only child of the dead Nymphadora and Remus Lupine - Ted Remus Lupine.

        In 2007, Harry was promoted to head of the Auror Bureau at the age of 26, which was a record. Then he joined the Wizarding Law Compliance Department, and in 2019 he became its head.
