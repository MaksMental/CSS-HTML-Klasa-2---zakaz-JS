            <font size="5"><b>History</b></font> <br><br>

            The castle was built in the late early Middle Ages around 993 AD by a wizard architect and four of the most famous wizards of all time: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. From that moment on, the castle that housed the school of magic was recognized as the best witchcraft school in the world. <br>
            <br>


            <font size="5"><b>the chamber of Secrets</b></font> <br><br>


            As legend has it, Salazar Slytherin built a secret chamber in the castle, commonly known as the Chamber of Secrets. He was supposed to create it before leaving Hogwarts, because of his conflict with Godric Gryffindor and the other founders, who did not agree with the selection of blood purity among students. Slytherin decided to leave the castle, but before he did, he built and sealed a room called the Chamber of Secrets, in which the basilisk would reside - a monster designed to cleanse the school of all sludge, squibs and hybrids. Only the rightful heir of Slytherin could open the Chamber and free the basilisk. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Initially, the Chamber of Secrets was intended as a room for the study of black magic, which could be rejected by the rest of the founders of Hogwarts. The interior of the chamber is not accidental. The gigantic statue of Slytherin was supposed to show his greatness and haughtiness above the other founders of the school. The serpent statues were to symbolize his ability to speak in the serpent language. Sealing the chamber and turning it into a monster's lair happened after Slytherin was kicked out of the school. When the Chamber was built, it was accessed by a series of trapdoors and hidden tunnels. In the 18th century, the Hogwarts plumbing was expanded. Before that, wizards would take care of their needs where they stood and then remove the impurities. Expanding the plumbing risked destroying the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, as the construction of a bathroom was planned here. At that time, a descendant of Slytherin was present at the school, and the ancestor of Tom Riddle - Corvinus Gaunt. Thanks to him, the hidden entrance was secretly saved and placed among a modern sewage system. The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets was in the bathroom, where in one of the sinks you could find a secret passage leading to the Chamber, inhabited by the basilisk. To open it, you had to speak with the tongue of snakes. <br> <br>

            For centuries, the existence of the chamber was considered a legend. The school was searched many times, but was not found. The reason for not finding the way to the Chamber was because no one was looking for it was Parselmouth. <br>
            <br> <br>



            <font size="5"><b>Dungeons</b></font> <br><br>


            The Hogwarts dungeons were several levels underground and it was much cooler there than in the main castle. There are many rooms mainly related to Slytherin. <br> <br>

            The underground chambers were a series of rooms in the basement of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that were used to protect the Philosopher's Stone from August 1, 1991 until June 4, 1992. There were a total of seven chambers that guarded the Philosopher's Stone. Each of them contained some obstacle or task to be performed, which was to cause difficulties in reaching the Stone: <br> <br>

            1. A three-headed dog guarding the hatch that allowed entry to the next chambers. In order to put him to sleep, you had to play a melody on any instrument. <br> <br>

            2. Devil's snares that choked and dragged all intruders. They held the victim particularly tight when she tried to violently escape her trap. <br> <br>

            3. Flying keys that were kept in a perfectly lit chamber with a high ceiling. There was also a door that was locked and enchanted in such a way that it could not be opened with the Alohomora spell. It was necessary to find, among a hundred enchanted keys, one to match the lock. The brooms in the room had to be used for this task. <br> <br>

            4. Human-sized wizard chess set in a very dark room. To get to the next chamber, you had to play a game and defeat the King. <br> <br>

            5. A mountain troll lying on the floor of the fifth chamber, looking dead, with a bloody bump on his forehead. It had a very unpleasant smell that spread throughout the room. <br> <br>

            6. Logical riddle, the correct solution of which guaranteed the passage through the black flames to the chamber with the Stone and the return through the purple flames to the previous chambers. <br> <br>

            7. Ain Eingarp's mirror, located in the last chamber, showed the wizard having the Stone but not actually holding it in his hand. <br> <br> <br>



            <font size="5"><b>The Great Staircase</font> <br><br>

            The Grand Staircase is a huge staircase at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the main task of which is to provide access to every floor of the castle, including the dungeons. The inner walls of the tower in which they are located are covered with hundreds of portraits, some of which hide secret passages to other areas of the school. The stairs lead from floor to floor, all the way to the seventh floor, where they end. Stairs can move up and down the staircase, usually when a student is on them. Some stairs can play tricks. However, it is second nature to most older students to jump over them. The escalator was the brainchild of Rowena Ravenclaw, one of the founders of Hogwarts. <br> <br> <br>


            <font size="5"><b>Gryffindor Dormitory</b></font> <br><br>

            The only known dormitory was that of Harry Potter, who shared a room with Ronald Weasley, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan and Neville Longbottom. The dormitory was on the seventh floor and was surrounded by the windows of the Gryffindor Tower. <br> <br> <br>



            <font size="5"><b>Ravenclaw Dormitory</b></font> <br><br>

            located in the Ravenclaw Tower, on the west side of Hogwarts. Each room had four-poster beds covered with blue silk bedspreads. There were also windows with blue curtains in each room. Most likely there was a wardrobe next to each bed where the students could put their clothes etc. There were blue carpets on the floor. There was also one desk in the room for the Ravenclaws to study freely, as this is what their home prides itself on. <br> <br> <br>



            <font size="5"><b>Slytherin Dormitory</b></font> <br><br>

            The dormitory was situated in the dungeons where Slytherin students lived. The room was decorated with Slytherin crests. There were as many beds in it as there were tenants. Each had dark green canopies hanging from four wooden columns. Torches hung on the stone walls to illuminate the room. The floor (also stone) was covered with decorative gray carpets. A copper chandelier hung from the ceiling. There were slight chessboard accents in some places on the walls. There were windows with green curtains in the room. Through them, Slytherins could see the creatures that live in Lake Hogwarts. Each wall was joined by columns from which little torches protruded. <br> <br> <br>


            <font size="5"><b>Hufflepuff Dormitory</b></font> <br><br>

            a dormitory belonging to the Hufflepuff students. It was located near the Hogwarts kitchen. The front door was round. Each room had yellow and black sofas and armchairs. The rooms were also equipped with warmers hanging on the walls, copper lamps and posters (most likely with Hufflepuff coats of arms).
