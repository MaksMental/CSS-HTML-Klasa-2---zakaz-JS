        Professor Albus Persiwal Wulfryk Brian Dumbledore (Knight of the Order of Merlin, First Class) (born 1881 - died June 1997 at the Astronomical Tower) - an outstanding half-blood wizard, first a transmutation teacher, and later a long-time director of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, winner of the Order First Class Merlin for his work in the wizarding world, Supreme Chief of the International Wizarding Confederation, Chief Magician of the Wizengamot.
        He had a phoenix, Fawkes, in his office. In 1945 he became famous for defeating Gellert Grindelwald and placing him in Nurmengard. Dumbledore founded the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War, which was built to fight Lord Voldemort. After the Dark Lord's disappearance, the order was suspended and revived after his rebirth. He destroyed Voldemort's Horcruxes, he was the only wizard the wizard feared. Albus Dumbledore possessed all the Deathly Hallows, albeit at different times. He was immortalized on cards from Chocolate Frogs. Albus was known for his alchemical work with Nicolas Flamel and for inventing twelve ways to use dragon's blood.

        Albus is by far the most powerful and smartest wizard we meet in the series. Dumbledore knew powerful magic, he was exceptionally intelligent. At the end of his successful life, he became a mentor to Harry Potter. He introduced him to the life of Tom Marvolo Riddle, he taught the boy the knowledge of the enemy, and he always said that Voldemort was a great wizard but he lacked love.

        Albus Dumbledore made a mistake, carelessly putting on Marvolo Gaunt's ring, one of the Horcruxes, which had burned his hand. Severus Snape stopped the professor's death by several months. Snape and Dumbledore planned the Headmaster's death. At the Astronomy Tower on June 30, 1997, Snape killed Albus Dumbledore at the end of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.
