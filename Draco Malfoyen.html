        Draco Lucius Malfoy (born June 5, 1980) - a pureblood wizard, the only son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy (née Black). He attended the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1991-1998, and was assigned to Slytherin at the sorting ceremony, along with all of his family. He usually stuck with his friends Vincent Crabe and Gregory Goyl. In the fifth school year, he became a prefect and joined the Inquisition Brigade. In the sixth year of his education, he became a Death Eater. The events of his teenage years strongly influenced Draco and his beliefs. The Malfoys avoided Azkaban, but after the war, Draco refused to follow his parents' ideals any longer. In time, he married Astoria Greengrass, Daphne's younger sister, his peers at school. The Greengrass family also underwent (albeit less violently) a shift from purebred ideals to a more tolerant way of life. Lucius Malfoy was unhappy with his son's choice because he had more hopes of choosing a wife from a better family. He hoped it would be someone more distinguished from the Intact Eight. <br>

        Draco and Astoria had one son whom they named Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Both he and his wife became more tolerant of Muggle-borns and Squibs. J.K. Rowling said in an interview that Draco wanted to raise Scorpius to be a better man than him

        On September 1, 2017, while sending his son to his first year at Hogwarts, Draco greeted Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny at Kings Cross with a nod. The relationship between Harry and Draco was much better than when they were students, but they were still not considered anything close to friendship. Independent and rich, without the need to work, Draco, with his wife and son, moved to Malfoy's manor. His passion was keeping the family's old collection of black magic artifacts (which he did not use and kept in glass cases). He also got a high position at the Ministry of Magic.
